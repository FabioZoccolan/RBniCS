### 0. Introduction
**RBniCS** is an implementation in **FEniCS** of several reduced order modelling techniques (and, in particular, certified reduced basis method and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition-Galerkin methods) for coercive problems. It is ideally suited for an introductory course on reduced basis methods and reduced order modelling, thanks to an object-oriented approach and an intuitive and versatile python interface. To this end, it has been employed in several doctoral courses on "Reduced Basis Methods for Computational Mechanics".

**RBniCS** can also be used as a basis for more advanced projects that would like to assess the capability of reduced order models in their existing **FEniCS**-based software, thanks to the availability of several reduced order methods (such as reduced basis and proper orthogonal decomposition) and algorithms (such as successive constraint method, empirical interpolation method) in the library.

Several tutorials are provided. This software is also a companion of the introductory reduced basis handbook:

### 1. Prerequisites
**RBniCS** requires
* **FEniCS**, with PETSc and SLEPc, for computations during the offline stage;
* **numpy** for computations during the online stage;
* **python-glpk**, a python interface to the glpk library for linear programming, necessary for the successive constraints method.

### 2. Installation and usage
Simply clone the **RBniCS** public repository:
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/RBniCS/RBniCS.git /RB/ni/CS/path
```
The core of the **RBniCS** code is in the **RBniCS** subfolder of the repository.

Then Make sure that both **FEniCS** and **RBniCS** are in your PYTHONPATH,
```
source /FE/ni/CS/path/share/fenics/fenics.conf
export PYTHONPATH="/RB/ni/CS/path:$PYTHONPATH"
```
and run a **RBniCS** python script (such as the tutorials) as follows:
```
python RBniCS_example.py
```

### 3. RBniCS virtual machine
If you want to try **RBniCS** out but do not have **FEniCS** already installed, you can:
* if you have VirtualBox, [download a virtual machine](http://goo.gl/Q4nQ7E) based on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (username and password: rbnics);
* if you have docker, [pull our docker image from Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/rbnics/rbnics/) with `docker pull rbnics/rbnics`.

**RBniCS** software is located in $HOME/RBniCS. All required dependencies are already installed, and a precomputed offline stage is also provided.

### 4. Tutorials
Several tutorials are provided the [**tutorials** subfolder](https://gitlab.com/RBniCS/RBniCS/tree/master/tutorials).
* **Tutorial 1**: introduction to the capabilities of **RBniCS**: reduced basis method for scalar problems.
* **Tutorial 2**: introduction to the capabilities of **RBniCS**: POD-Galerkin method for vector problems.
* **Tutorial 3**: geometrical parametrization.
* **Tutorial 4**: non-compliant problems, successive constraint method.
* **Tutorial 5**: empirical interpolation method.

### 5. Authors and contributors
